## About The Project

![Screen Shot](photos/home_screenshot.png)

I wanted to create this project to study how to make a cool Fullstack website. I'm using Angular with Django, featuring REST.

Main features:

* Ordering dishes with different modifiers (additional sauce etc.)
* Common users and vendors (probably custom auth, not built-in Django. WIP)
* Administration

I hope that site will be awesome soon :smile:

## Built With

Frontend: 
* [Angular](https://angular.io)

Backend:
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)
* [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
* [Pgbouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org)

## Getting Started

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dborodin836/hinkali-store.git
$ cd hinkali-store
```

The easiest way to start projct is requires Docker,
If you don't have Docker [install it](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
And run simple command.

**This could take a while...**
